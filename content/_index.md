## Jupyter Hub - The Data Lab

A lab has been created for clinicians to explore synthetic data using Python and R.

This is an instance of [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) (specifically, [The Littlest JupyterHub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/)), which provides a Python or R environment in your browser.
